# Kalabox UI

This is the UI component to the Kalabox. By itself it doesn't do much of
anything. The easiest way to get it right now is to request an access code at
http://kalabox.io. That said we will soon be releasing manual install scripts.
So check back in a bit!

## Installation

Go to kalabox.io and request an access code!
